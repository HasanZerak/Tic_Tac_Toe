# Tic_Tac_Toe
A tic tac toe game to play with your friends or a bot.

1. I began by structuring the HTML and adding basic CSS to the DOM. 
2. Added a popup function to take user data, that leads to the game board right after. 
3. Created two modules, namely,
    a. gameBoard, to manage the flow of the game and the logic.
    b. display controller, to display the board and manipulate DOM elements. 
4. Created a factory, 
    a. player, to create two players and assign them a sign each. 
5. gameboard has an array gameboard[] to store and run the game. 

6. Content of the gameBoard array is printed on the webpage using a for loop in the displayController module.
